<h3>About Women’s P2P</h3>

<p>Women’s Peer-to-Peer Network is a diverse, global community creating by-women, for-women communication tools that support women in developing countries around key issues (such as ending violence against women and supporting women running for public office). By building on tools women already use (such as community radio and basic phones), we are bridging the technology gender gap created by illiteracy, access, and privacy concerns. We bring grassroots and technical women together to collaborate as equals - in the same manner women have been collaborating throughout time - first in conversation and community, then holding follow-up events (hackathons) that result in tools. Inspired by grassroots movements that have brought diverse populations of women together across borders to change history (such as the 2005 Liberian elections), our long-term vision is to create a network that connects every woman on earth, irrespective of computer access, language differences, and other traditional barriers.
